## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

Details For Resubmittion:

The error:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "edu.grinnell.csc207.util.AssociativeArray.getKeys()" because "this.image" is null, leading the file couldn't be compiled

Has not been observed by me. Additionally due to the different nature of this MP you are not looking to open the aacnestedhw folder inside the AACNestedHW folder. My appologies for any difficulty in accessing this but this project was made before a solution was found and is no longer compatable with the given solution.
